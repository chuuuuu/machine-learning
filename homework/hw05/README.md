# HW3
In this homework, there are two .ipynb files.
In HW05_bt.ipynb, I train a back-translation model which is used to generate mono dataset from monolingual data.
In HW05_ft.ipynb, I train a model with training dataset and mono dataset.

## Instructions
1. run HW05_bt.ipynb until best_val_BLEU ~ 21.9
2. run HW05_ft.ipynb until best_val_BLEU ~ 30.0
